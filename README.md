# Kyra Frontend Assignment: Asset Review

## How to Run 
- `cd api && npm ci && npm run dev` (runs on port 3000)
- `cd front && npm ci && npm run dev` (nextjs frontend runs on port 3001)

## Notes on my approach
- I used nextjs with shadcn and react-query 
- I changed the API a bit to save some querying (I did get everything to work without changing the API, the last commit with unchanged API is this: 836c962e59def658f7529e9a7dfa24d27dcd7890)
